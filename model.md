title: Modeling Approach

## Modeling Approach

We considered a number of modeling approaches before deciding upon our final design. 

One approach we considered was scraping the lyrics wiki database to find songs that were similar based on their lyrics. However, we decided that there weren’t enough differences within lyrics to distinguish songs from one another in a useful way (too many songs are about love!). 

We also considered splitting each playlist and then using machine learning methods to train selections of songs and using how well the list of songs reflected the list of songs in other playlists. However, we didn’t feel like this was necessarily an adequate measure of ‘success’.
